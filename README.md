# TeraISAC v1.0 A Physical-Layer Simulator for Terahertz Integrated Sensing and Communication

1. The air interface of this simulator supports four waveforms, including OFDM, DFT-s-OFDM, OTFS, and DFT-s-OTFS
2. The user can set various waveform numerologies at the transmitter, such as subcarrier spacing, subcarrier number, symbol number.
3. The sensing parameter estimation and imaging are implemented at the sensing receiver.
4. The channel estimation and data detection are implemented at the communication receiver.
